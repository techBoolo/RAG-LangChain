  Phase 1: Setup and Dependencies

  First, we need to ensure we have all the necessary Python packages.

   1. Required Packages:
       * langchain: The core library for building our components.
       * pypdf: The recommended library for loading and parsing PDF documents.
       * langchain_community: This package contains many of the third-party integrations, including document loaders and
         vector stores.
       * faiss-cpu: This is the vector store we will use. It's a powerful and efficient library from Facebook AI for
         similarity search. We'll use the CPU version as it requires no special hardware.
       * langchain-ollama: To get the embeddings from our local llama3 model.

   2. Installation Command:
      provide the command to install all these dependencies at once.

  Phase 2: The Ingestion Pipeline
  
  logical steps.

   1. Step 1: Load the Document
       * We'll use the PyPDFLoader from langchain_community.document_loaders to read a PDF file.
       * For this example, I'll assume we have a sample PDF file named vscode-mac.pdf in the same directory but inside docs folder.

   2. Step 2: Split the Document into Chunks
       * A whole document is too large to fit into the context of a language model. We need to break it into smaller,
         manageable pieces, or "chunks."
       * We'll use the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for this. It's a robust splitter that tries to break text at logical
         points (like newlines and sentences) to keep related content together.

   3. Step 3: Create Embeddings
       * This is the core of turning text into a format the computer can understand for similarity searching.
       * We will use OllamaEmbeddings to connect to your local Llama 3 model and generate a numerical vector (an
         embedding) for each text chunk. Each vector represents the semantic meaning of the chunk.

   4. Step 4: Store Chunks in a Vector Store
       * Once we have the embeddings, we need to store them in a specialized database that can perform rapid similarity
         searches.
       * We will use FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for this. The script will take all the text chunks and their
         corresponding embeddings and load them into a FAISS index.
       * This index will then be saved to a local file (e.g., faiss_index) so it can be loaded and used later for querying
         without having to re-process the PDF every time.

  This plan will give you a complete, runnable script that prepares your document and stores it in a vector database,
  setting the stage for the "retrieval" part of RAG.
